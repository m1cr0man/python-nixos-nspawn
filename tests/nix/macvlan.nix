# Test environment for MACVLAN functionality.
#
# Just as it was the case for the existing `nixos-container` implementation, I originally
# planned an abstraction here as well, but decided against it for the following
# reasons:
# * systemd-networkd already provides well-designed abstractions for network configurations
#   and a certain degree of declarativity.
#
# * in case of networkd we'd have to (1) create a host-interface for a MACVLAN (of course)
#   and declare it as macvlan interface in the config of the *physical interface itself*.
#   This means that we'd need a way to declare this in NixOS which turns out to be non-trivial
#   since networkd only uses the first `.network` file (in lexical order) it can find
#   so there's a risk that we'd invalidate other configurations with this.
#
# So to summarize, the abstractions I tried were leaky and thus useless. But now that we can
# use systemd-nspawn itself for containers (and consider NixOS just a thin abstraction layer),
# this isn't a big deal IMHO.
